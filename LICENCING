This software is unencumbered and free-as-in-freedom.

This project is dual-licensed under The Unlicense or the BSD Zero Clause
License. (SPDX: `Unlicense OR 0BSD`)

The spirit and intent of the project is to treat the work as public domain via
The Unlicense, but providing the BSD Zero Clause License where public domain
dedication is not possible due to policies bound to a contributor or their
employer. However, this is not a legal condition.

Either way, you are free to use the software as you wish, without any
restrictions or obligations, subject only to the warranty disclaimers in the
licence texts.

> Does dual licencing not invalidate the ethos behind The Unlicense?

Well yeah, but like, even if ten percent of code is 0BSD-licenced, the rest
is still unlicenced. And that's... good enough, and better than the
alternative of a fully 0BSD-licenced project. _Everyone should be able to
contribute._
