marrying [pydantic](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic) models and
[tomlkit](https://github.com/sdispater/tomlkit) documents for data validated,
style-preserving toml files

uses generics to automagically preserve model types, so you don't lose out on model type
information :D

## usage

### installation

there are three notable methods to use tomlantic with your project:

1. install from pypi

   ```shell
   pip install tomlantic
   ```

2. install from source

   ```shell
   pip install git+https://github.com/markjoshwel/tomlantic
   ```

3. directly include tomlantic.py in your project

   ```shell
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markjoshwel/tomlantic/refs/tags/v0.2.1/tomlantic/tomlantic.py
   ```

   tomlantic is a single file module and is dually licenced for public domain
   dedication, or a public domain-equivalent licence. so, use it however you please!  
   see the [licence](#licence) section for more information.

### quickstart

```python
import pydantic
import tomlkit

from tomlantic import ModelBoundTOML


class Project(pydantic.BaseModel):
    model_config = pydantic.ConfigDict(validate_assignment=True)
    name: str
    description: str
    typechecked: bool


class File(pydantic.BaseModel):
    model_config = pydantic.ConfigDict(validate_assignment=True)
    project: Project


toml_doc = tomlkit.parse(
    "[project]\n"
    'name = "tomlantic"\n'
    'description = "marrying pydantic models and tomlkit documents"\n'
    "typechecked = false  # change this!\n"
)

# where tomlantic comes in handy
toml = ModelBoundTOML(File, toml_doc)

# access the model with .model and change the model freely
model: File = toml.model
model.project.typechecked = True

# dump the model back to a toml document
new_toml_doc = toml.model_dump_toml()
assert new_toml_doc["project"]["typechecked"] == True  # type: ignore

print(new_toml_doc.as_string())
# ^^ [project]
#    name = "tomlantic"
#    description = "marrying pydantic models and tomlkit documents"
#    typechecked = true  # change this!
```

my wish is that, in jurisdictions that recognise public domain dedications,
the Unlicence would take precedence. and in other jurisdictions or due to
legal restrictions where a copyright safety net may be required,
the 0BSD License would take precedence.
